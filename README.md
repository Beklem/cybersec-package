# cybersec package
massive cybersecurity package with information gathering, password tools, etc.

# still in development
as of now - this is a short summary with working scripts, i am kinda compiling them into a terminal run application, and they do need to be adapted to work there properly. i'm currently working on the password tools. 

# current to do list 
hash identifier
dictionary attack script (with rockyou and other user paths for files)
brute force attack
effective wifi password (with deauthentication attack to capture handshake with aircrack)
network brute force script

metadata extractor (a touch of forensics didn't hurt anyone)
web asset scanner
arp spoofer (mitm type beat)
host to ip resolver
reaver wps tools (can brute force wps pins)
bluetooth honeypot (needs testing)
ftp auto bypass

cms scanner (web content management system detector)
vulnerability auditor (expose sensitive vulnerabilities)
server user enumerator
sql injection scanner (tests web apps for sql injection points)
xss prober (finds vulnerabilities in headers etc...)
file brute forcer (uncover admin stuff, configs you name it)
cors misconfig checker (finds vulnerabilities for xss attacks)
weeman server cloner (capture target site and locally host it)
sslstrip https downgrader (capture credentials that would normally be encrypted)
directory finder (discover misconfigurated directories)
zip file finder (find common web paths, brute forced dirs)
bypass cloudfare (yeah)

payload encoder/decoder (deliver paylaods, analyse code)
xor encryptor/decryptor (malware obfuscation for crypto)
exif data cleaner (op sec to prevent info leakage)

reverse shell generator (can make payloads)
https file server (temp for receiving data)
netcat listener (quick testing, transfer files etc)
log cleaner (log files, remove entries)
